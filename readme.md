About Dolstagis
===============

Dolstagis is a web application framework for ASP.NET MVC inspired at least in
part by Python's Django framework. It is intended to be a "batteries included"
option, ultimately offering out of the box features such as authentication and 
user management, an admin section, commenting, and much more.

There are no releases as yet: this project is currently still in the early
stages of development.
