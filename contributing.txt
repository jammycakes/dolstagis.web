Contributing
============

As of version 0.1.0-alpha, I am using git-flow for branch management, with one
difference: mainline development takes place on master and the production
branch is called 'production'. This is intended to make things easier for
contributors who are not familiar with git-flow.

Building
--------
The build scripts are written in Python and developed against Python 3.3;
earlier versions are untested. The project is built against .NET 4.5 on
Visual Studio 2012/2013.

Supported frameworks and browsers
---------------------------------
Dolstagis.Web requires .NET 4.5 or later; earlier versions are not supported.
Client-side functionality included out of the box (admin and report pages,
default error pages, etc) only supports IE9 or later; users who require
support for older browsers are expected to supply their own templates. New
code SHOULD include hooks or options to allow them to do so if necessary.

Coding conventions
------------------
Use the Visual Studio out of the box default formatting rules.
Line lengths SHOULD be kept to 120 characters or less.
Throw an exception if a method can't do what its name says that it does.
Return null to indicate that something was not found or does not exist.
Methods that return collections or enumerables MUST NOT return null.
